# GleamGlumScraper

Some Quick Notes:

-I've been using macOS but I spent time making sure it works on Windows. 
On Windows if you try and scrape the same video it will give you an error since Windows won't replace files that have the same name.

-The current version of pytube (12.0.0) is working as of 2/18/2022 without any modifications to the package's source code.
